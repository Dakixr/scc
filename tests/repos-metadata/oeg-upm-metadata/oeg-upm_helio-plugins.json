(Optional) Upload a release to the official Helio plugins repository \nIn following subsections, all these steps are explained in detail. Notice that any plugin developed, published, and released in the official Helio plugins repository will have an Apache 2.0 license. \nA fork is a copy of the parent repository, which however, remains synchronised with the former repository. When new modifications are commited to the forked repository these are marked as changes from the original repository, and thus, can be later be pushed to the original repository requesting a Pull Request. The bottom line idea is to fork the Helio plugins repository, include the new code in the fork, and then create a Pull Request to merge the new plugin code in the original repository. To fork the Helio plugins repository click in the \"Fork\" button on the upper right-corner of the repository page. \nOnce forked the a copy of the Helio plugins repository must appear in the private account of the user who forked the repotiroty. \n",

For this end create a new java class for the plugin and extend any of the interfaces that Helio supports as pluggable. These interfaces and the goal of the code that implements them are the following:  \nDataProvider this kind of components retrieve and fetch data from a new data source, regarless the format of such data. For instance, a new provider could retrie the data from an MQTT broker regardless if the format of such data is json, xml, csv, or any other. \nDataHandler this kind of components are used to filter and handle the data relying on their format. For instance, a new handler could select some values from an XML file using Json Path expressions, or even iterate over a list in XML using these Json Path expressions. \nHelioCache this kind of components are used to store the RDF generated by Helio. For instance, a new cache could store in Git Hub the RDF been generated by Helio providing versioning capabilities to the RDF been produced by Helio in time. \nFunctions this kind of components are used to extend the functions that can be called from the mappings in Helio. \nMappingTranslator this kind of components are used to extend the mapping languages that Helio understands. \nOnce specified the interface to be implemented the IDE will require a set of methods to be implemented (to know more about these methods and their socope check the Helio Java Docs, otherwise, the plugins in this repository can be taken as an example). As a result, these methods will implement the functionalities of the new plugin. \nFinally, it is required to create a file README.md documenting the plugin, especially, indicating the structure of the expected json document to setup the new plugin. Once all the code is developed, register the new changes in the git branch of the new plugin. For this end, follow this excerpt of commands. \n",
