Also, this image has all the software necessary to run all the features of the last version of GeoKettle and it will be updated when the dependencies, libraries or OS base would be safe to be updated. \nReason 2: this docker image has been compiled with source code of GeoKettle last version and Java 8, so all the software and recent plugins are working well because there is compatibility between them. This is a critical feature, especially for Mac OS version. \n",
