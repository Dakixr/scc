If you\ndon't have the Conda tools installed, follow this\n[guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) to\ninstall it. We recommend installing Miniconda installation rather than the\nfull Anaconda installation.\n\nNext, execute the following steps to install the latest stable release\nof KGTK:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n kgtk-env python=3.9\nconda activate kgtk-env\nconda install -c conda-forge graph-tool\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\npip --no-cache install -U kgtk\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n```\n\nPlease see our [installation document](/docs/install.md) for more details.
