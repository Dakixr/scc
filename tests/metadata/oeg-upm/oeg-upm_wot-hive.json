Download the WoT Hive service\nDownload the latest release of WoT Hive into a folder. Notice that the releases have several files that must be downloaded and placed in the same folder:\n* **log4j.properties** allows to customise the logs of the service\n* **schema.json** allows to perform JSON schema validation over the Thing Descriptions\n* **shape.ttl** allows to perform SHACL shapes validation over the Thing Descriptions\n* **wothive.jar** is the jar of the service\n\nOnce downloaded all the resources in the same folder the service can be ran using the command\n\n```bash\njava -jar wothive.jar\n```\n\nWhen the service is up and running a file called *configuration.json* will be created in the directory of the jar.  The service will run by default in port 9000. \n#:#:#:#: 2. Set up the triple store\nIn order to connect the WoT Hive to a remote triple store a `POST` request must be sent to `/configuration/triplestore` containing the in the body the following JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"updateEnpoint\": \"http://localhost:4567/sparql\",\n    \"queryEnpoint\": \"http://localhost:4567/sparql\",\n    \"queryUsingGET\": true\n}\n```\n\nNotice that `\"queryEndpoint\"`and `\"updateEndpoint\"` must have as value the correct endpoints of the triple store for either querying or inserting data. Finally, if the triple store implements the SPARQL protocol through `GET` requests then leave `\"queryUsingGET\": true`, otherwise, for using `POST`set it to false `\"queryUsingGET\": false`.\n\n#:#: WoT Hive API\n\n| Endpoint \t| Method \t| Headers \t| Reference \t| Description \t|\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n| `/.well-known/wot-thing-description` \t| `GET` \t| `N/A` \t| [Introduction Mechanim](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:introduction-well-known) \t| Provides the Thing Description of the WoT Hive directory \t|\n| `/configuration` \t| `GET` \t| `N/A` \t| [Management](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:exploration-directory-api-management) \t| Provides a JSON with the all the configurations of the WoT Hive \t|\n| `/configuration` \t| `POST` \t| `N/A` \t| [Management](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:exploration-directory-api-management) \t| The body of the request must contain a JSON with all the configurations of the WoT Hive. \t|\n| `/api/things{?offset,limit,sort_by,sort_order}` \t| `GET` \t| `Accept`: `application/td+json`or `text/turtle`  \t| [Listing](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:exploration-directory-api-registration-listing) \t| Provides a listing of the stored Thing Descriptions in JSON-LD framed or Turtle \t|\n| `/api/things` \t| `POST` \t| `Content-Type`: `application/td+json` \t| [Creation (Anonymous)](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:exploration-directory-api-registration-creation) \t| Creates an [anonymous Thing Description](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#:dfn-wot-anonymous-thing-description), provided in the body as JSON-LD framed.
