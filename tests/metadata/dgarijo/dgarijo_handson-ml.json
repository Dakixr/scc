If your browser does not open automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree). Click on `index.ipynb` to get started. You can visit [http://localhost:8888/nbextensions](http://localhost:8888/nbextensions) to activate and configure Jupyter extensions.\n\nThat's it! Have fun learning ML.\n",
