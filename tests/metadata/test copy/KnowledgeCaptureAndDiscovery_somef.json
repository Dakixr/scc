If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:\n\n```bash \ndocker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash\n```\nIf you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.\n\n\n",
